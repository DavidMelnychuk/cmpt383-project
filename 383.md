# CMPT 383 PROJECT

React Frontend.
Go server acts as a REST API end point and as the file server to store files for the python RPC server.

Access the application at localhost:3000

Go server listening on PORT 8080 on guest machine, accessible on host machine with PORT 8080.
React client deployed on PORT 3000 on guest machine, accessible on host machine with PORT 3000.
RabbitMQ deployed on PORT 5672

Possible work:
Change favicon to AI brain icon.
Create UI/CSS = Last Step = Make it pretty.
Add Drag and Drop (probably waste of time).
Add export model .h file to user (cherry on top)

Next Steps:
Can do the ML stuff separately off the server first to test it before
adding it to the RPC call. I.e make sure model trains as expected because
otherwise we don't really have a way of making sure it works. I guess I can listen on the server and print to console there...
Once I have the the model done, then I need to work on serving it
so that it can be accessed as a REST api.
Once it can, then upload sample image and implement the predict function
to talk from front end to the REST server.
once that's done then it's basically just refactoring the code, making
the project structure clean, and making the front end look nice and
add things like progress bars, good UX, practice my REACT and CSS.

Code in following files:
autoML/server
main.go = main server entry point with gin
/controllers contain API logic to handle REST routes
files uploaded to the server stored in /uploadedFiles

autoML/client
Contains React code for the frontend.
services in /services
REACTJS components in /components
App.js entry point

autoML/rpc-ml # Rename to rpc-server
contains python rpc server code.

Example Dataset taken from https://www.kaggle.com/moltean/fruits only including the red apples and bananas.

Had way too many issues with vagrant and chef on my Windows machine so used docker instead.

Everything should work with a docker-compose up. Email me if it doesn't and I can help troubleshoot.
