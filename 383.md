# CMPT 383 PROJECT

Vagrant up doesn't work with chef for some reason. Chef bug? Ignore for now. After chef fails to install, run a vagrant provision. 

React Frontend.
Go server acts as a REST API end point and as the file server to store files for the python service.

After vagrant up. Vagrant provision. 

Do an npm start = starts client.
go run main.go = starts go server
need to run python rpc server as well.

Access the application at localhost:3001

Go server listening on PORT 8080 on guest machine, accessible on host machine with PORT 8081.

React client deployed on port 3000 on guest machine, accessible on host machine with port 3001.

Possible work:
Change favicon to AI brain icon.
Create UI/CSS = Last Step = Make it pretty.
Add Drag and Drop (probably waste of time).
Add export model .h file to user (cherry on top)

Next Steps:
Create python server in RPC
Add go RPC call to main.go server
Test with the basics that exist in example demos and hook it up
with a button on the front end.
Then keep the call, but make sure the python server downloads the files and prints them.
then can add the ML stuff.
Can do the ML stuff separately off the server first to test it before
adding it to the RPC call. I.e make sure model trains as expected because
otherwise we don't really have a way of making sure it works. I guess I can listen on the server and print to console there...
Once I have the the model done, then I need to work on serving it
so that it can be accessed as a REST api.
Once it can, then upload sample image and implement the predict function
to talk from front end to the REST server.
once that's done then it's basically just refactoring the code, making
the project structure clean, and making the front end look nice and
add things like progress bars, good UX, practice my REACT and CSS.

Code in following files:
autoML/server
main.go = main server entry point with gin
/controllers contain API logic to handle REST routes
files uploaded to the server stored in /uploadedFiles

autoML/client
Contains React code for the frontend.
services in /services
REACTJS components in /components
App.js entry point

autoML/rpc-ml # Rename to rpc-server
contains python rpc server code.
